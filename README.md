# anothertodo

A simple SpringBoot Todo Application, with an accent on the _simple_.

## Implementation

Just uses the out-of-the-box basics of the SpringBoot wiring. Makes liberal use of immutable objects for the Json interface layer.

## What's that Jar File Doing There?

There is a SpringBoot jar uploaded to the repo. This is an attempt to coerce OpenShift into spinning up a standalone app without the Widlfly WAR file wrapper palaver.
